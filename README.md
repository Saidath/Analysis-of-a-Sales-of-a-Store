## **Key Features**
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - Analyze variables like sales, quantity, and discounts to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
  - Visualize data distributions using histograms, box plots, and time series plots.

- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Examine relationships between sales and other variables, including discounts, regions, and customer segments.
  - Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts for insights into correlations and category-wise trends.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Leverage Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and visually appealing data visualizations.
